# Functioning nextclade files:

## For Linux:
        nc_code_bash.sh is to be used as plugin in Geneious  
        nc_code_bash.sh runs nextclade.sh, which is where all nextclade commands are located.

## For Windows:
        nextclade_windows.bat

 ### Python version:
        nextclade.py (can be run directly as a Geneious plugin on linux, but needs nextclade_windows_python.bat to operate on Windows)
        Should be possible to use on all operating system, given that pathways are updated for computer in use.



## Old files, not to be used: 
        nextclade_september.py
