# Functioning nextclade files:

## For Linux:
        nc_code_bash.sh is to be used as plugin in Geneious  
        nc_code_bash.sh runs np_code_update.sh, which is where all nextclade commands are located.
  
 ### Python version:
        nc_terminal.py 
  

## For Windows:
        nextclade_windows.bat
        
        OR
        
        nextclade_windows_py.bat to run nextclade_windows.py

## To print nextclade version and database tag: 
        version.py
        This script prints the current nextclade version and the tag provided from the database's json-file.
        This is meant to be implemented into the main scripts.


## Old files, not to be used: 
        nc_code.sh (older version of np_code_update.sh) 
        nextclade_winodws.ps1 (for Windows powershell)
